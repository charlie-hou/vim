==============================================================================
1. Highlighting matching parentheses				*rainbow-intro* {{{1

Rainbow Parentheses is a plugin that uses color to help identify matching
parentheses and other paired delimiters, along with operators within the defined
delimeters, according to their depth by using a different color for each
successive level.

The plugin provided the following features:
	1. Infinite depth.
	2. Customization of the colors spectrum used to denote depth.
	3. |Filetype| specialization.

==============================================================================
2. History							*rainbow-history* {{{1

This version was forked from Luo Chen's Rainbow Parentheses Improved and is
currently maintained on github at https://github.com/dbarsam/vim-rainbow-parentheses.

==============================================================================
3. Acknowledgements						*rainbow-acknowledgements* {{{1

Rainbow Parentheses is a feature that has been implemented nd re-implemenented
for vim before. This plugin modifies the techniques found in the follow
plugins based on personal work flow and really doesn't add anything new.

The following is a list of other plugins that perform the same functionality
and may or may not have influenced this plugin:
	* Francisco Lopes (https://github.com/oblitum/rainbow)
	* Luo Chen (http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=4176)
	* Kien et al. (https://github.com/kien/rainbow_parentheses.vim)

==============================================================================
4. Installation							*rainbow-install* {{{1

You can use this script as a plugin by copying the various components to their
respective directory.  See |add-global-plugin| for instructions.

								*rainbow-github*

If you use a bundle manager such as pathogen or vundle, you can use this plugin
via github: https://github.com/dbarsam/vim-rainbow-parentheses.git

==============================================================================
5. Activation							*rainbow-activation* {{{1

Activation for Rainbow Parentheses is a three step process that:
	1. Requires a global activation of the Rainbow Parentheses feature
	   across all buffers.  This state is stored in the |g:rainbow_activate|
	   variable.
	2. Requires a local definition of the delimiters to be used by the
	   Rainbow Parentheses feature.  This state is stored in the 
	   |b:rainbow_matchpairs| variable.
	2. (Optional) a local definition of the operators to be used by the
	   Rainbow Parentheses feature.  This state is stored in the 
	   |b:rainbow_operators| variable.


==============================================================================
6. Configuration						*rainbow-configuration* {{{1

								*rainbow-activate* *g:rainbow_activate*
The variable |g:rainbow_activate| stores the plugin's activity state.  If you >
	let g:rainbow_activate = 1
in your vimrc, the plugin will be active from startup.  However, to enable or
disable the plugin after startup, it is recommended that you use the
|RainbowToggle| command.

								*rainbow-matchpairs* *b:rainbow_matchpairs*
The variable |b:rainbow_matchpairs| stores the plugin's delimiter definition for
the buffer.  This definition is stored as a list of matchpair, which are also
stored as a list.  For example, >
	let b:rainbow_matchpairs = [['(', ')'], ['\[', '\]'], ['{', '}']]
is a valid format, defining the delimiter pairs '()', '[]', '{}' for the
current buffer.  To manipulate the |b:rainbow_matchpairs| variable for the
current buffer it is recommended to use the |RainbowMatchPairInsert| or the
|RainbowMatchPairRemove| commands.

								*rainbow-filetypes-matchpairs* *g:rainbow_filetype_matchpairs*

The variable |g:rainbow_filetype_matchpairs| stores the plugin's filetype delimiter
specialization.  This definition is stored as a dictionary matching a vim |filetype|
string to a matchpair definition.  For example, >
	let g:rainbow_filetype_matchpairs = {
	\ '*'         : [['(', ')'], ['\[', '\]'], ['{', '}']] ],
	\ 'tex'       : [['(', ')'], ['\[', '\]']] ],
	\ 'c,cpp,cs'  : [['(', ')'], ['\[', '\]'], ['{', '}']] ],
	\ 'html'      : [['(', ')'], ['\[', '\]'], ['{', '}'], ['<\a[^>]*>', '</[^>]*>']] ],
	\}

								*rainbow-operators* *b:rainbow_operators*
The variable |b:rainbow_operators| stores the plugin's operator definition for
the buffer.  This definition is stored as a list of characters.  For example, >
	let b:rainbow_operators = ['-', '+', '*']
is a valid format, defining the operators '-', '+', '*' for the current
buffer.  The operators will be highlighted with the same color as their
respective delimeter.  To manipulate the |b:rainbow_operator| variable for
the current buffer it is recommended to use the |RainbowOperatorInsert| or the
|RainbowOperatorRemove| commands.

								*rainbow-filetypes-operators* *g:rainbow_filetype_operator*

Like |g:rainbow_filetype_matchpairs|, |g:rainbow_filetype_operators| stores the
plugin's filetype operator specialization.  This definition is stored as a
dictionary matching a vim |filetype| string to an operator definition.  For
example, >
	let g:rainbow_filetype_operator = {
	\ '*'         : ['-', '+', '*', '/', '%', '=',]
	\ 'c,cpp,cs'  : ['-', '+', '*', '/', '%', '<', '>' , '&', '|', '=', ',']
	\}


								*rainbow-star*

To allow a general case for filetype specification, Rainbow Parentheses recognizes
the '*' as a fake-filetype.  If the plugin is unable to match the filetype and the
'*' fake-filetype is defined, the plugin will the use the respective definition
stored under the '*' entry.

								*rainbow-colors*

The plugin defines two list |g:rainbow_guifgs| and |g:rainbow_ctermfg| to
define the colors used to denote the parentheses depth.  If the depth exceeds
the number of colors in the list the plugin cycle through the list of colors.

								*rainbow-guifgs* *g:rainbow_guifgs*

The variable |g:rainbow_guifgs| is a list of color strings defined in |rgb.txt|
used to denote depth in gui instances of vim. The value in the list is passed
to the |highlight-guifg| parameter of the |highlight| command.

								*rainbow-ctermfgs* *g:rainbow_ctermfgs*

The variable |g:rainbow_ctermfgs| is a list of color strings defined in |rgb.txt|
used to denote depth in color terminal instances of vim. The value in the list
is passed to the |highlight-ctermfg| parameter of the |highlight| command.

								*g:rainbow_sgroup*

The variable |g:rainbow_sgroup| defines the name used by the plugin to create
syntax regions that define the delimiter pairs defined in|b:rainbow_matchpairs|.

								*g:rainbow_ogroup*

The variable |g:rainbow_ogroup| defines the name used by the plugin to create
syntax regions that define the operarors defined in |b:rainbow_operators|.

								*g:rainbow_hgroup*

The variable |g:rainbow_hgroup| defines the name used by the plugin to create
highlight group that define the colors used by the delimiter pairs.

==============================================================================
7. Commands							*rainbow-commands* {{{1

								*RainbowToggle*

|RainbowToggle| toggles the Rainbow Parentheses feature.

								*RainbowMatchPairInsert*

|RainbowMatchPairInsert| injects delimiters into the current buffer's delimiter
defintion and is the complementary comand to |RainbowMatchPairRemove|. For example, >
	RainbowMatchPairInsert < >
inserts the pair ['<', '>'] into the current buffer delimeter list. The current
buffer delimiter list is stored in |b:rainbow_matchpairs| so any change will be
lost when the variable is deleted with the buffer.

								*RainbowMatchPairRemove*
|RainbowMatchPairRemove| removes delimiters from the current buffer's delimiter
defintion and is the complementary comand to |RainbowMatchPairInsert|.  For example, >
	RainbowMatchPairRemove < >
removes the pair ['<', '>'] from the current buffer delimeter list.  The current
buffer delimiter list is stored in |b:rainbow_matchpairs| so any change will be
lost when the variable is deleted with the buffer.  

								*RainbowOperatorInsert*
|RainbowOperatorInsert| injects operators into the current buffer's operator
defintion and is the complementary comand to |RainbowOperatorRemove|.  For example, >
	RainbowOperatorInsert + = -
inserts the characters '+', '=', '-' into the current buffer operator list.  The
current buffer operator list is stored in |b:rainbow_operators| so any change will
be lost when the variable is deleted with the buffer.

								*RainbowOperatorRemove*
|RainbowOperatorRemove| removes operators from the current buffer's operator
defintion and is the complementary comand to |RainbowOperatorInsert|.  For example, >
	RainbowOperatorRemove + = -
removes the characters '+', '=', '-' from the current buffer operator list.  The
current buffer operator list is stored in |b:rainbow_operators| so any change will
be lost when the variable is deleted with the buffer.
